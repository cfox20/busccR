\title{Set the Box root folder for the Statistical Consulting Center}
\usage{
set_box_root()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the normalized path to the selected Box root directory.
}
\description{
Prompts the user with a dialog instructing them to select the local
filesystem path to the Statistical Consulting Center Box folder, then
opens a directory chooser. The selected folder path is stored in a
user-level configuration file for reuse by other package functions.
}
\details{
In RStudio, this function displays a modal dialog first. After the user
clicks "Next", it opens a folder selection window.

Outside of RStudio, the function prints an informational message and
uses an OS-native selection method when available.

The configuration is stored per-user and does not affect other users.
