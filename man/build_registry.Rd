\title{Build a CSV registry of all consulting projects (base R only)}
\usage{
build_registry(overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{overwrite}{Logical; if \code{FALSE} (default) and
\code{project_registry.csv} already exists, the function stops.
Set to \code{TRUE} to overwrite the existing file.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data.frame containing the compiled registry.
}
\description{
Reads all JSON project records from the \code{project_registry} folder
under the Box root and compiles them into a single CSV file named
\code{project_registry.csv}, stored in the Box root directory.
}
\details{
This implementation uses base R only (no package dependencies). Since base R
does not provide a full JSON parser, it supports the simple schema used by
this package: top-level scalar fields and arrays of strings (keywords, methods,
topics, consultants).
